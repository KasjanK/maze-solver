# Maze Solver

## What It Does
This project visually generates a maze and then finds a path from a starting point to an end point. It's designed to illustrate how search algorithms explore a graph or grid to find a solution.

## How It Works
The maze is generated using a common algorithm like **Recursive Backtracking**. Once the maze is created, a **Depth-First Search** algorithm explores the maze to locate a valid path from the start to the finish. The process is then visualized step-by-step, showing the exploration and the final solution path.

## Features
- Dynamic maze generation
- Interactive pathfinding visualization
- Adjustable maze size (e.g., 20x20, 30x30)
- Control over animation speed
- Clear visual distinction between explored cells and the final path

## Technologies Used
-   Python
-   Pygame (for graphical visualization)
